Hi. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a cute anime cat from outer universe. 

I spend most of my spare time doing some simple projects helping people around me. 

I also contributed to several open source projects just for fun:
- [CEF](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/pull-requests/?state=ALL&author=%7Bbaf9af8b-174e-463f-86d7-f6b07ac330a6%7D)
- [OBS](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/discussions/3853#discussioncomment-9718414)
- [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues?q=author%3Areitowo)
- [Chromium](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commits?user=carolwolfking&platform=Windows)
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pulls?q=author%3Areitowo)
